        <h1>Programming Language</h1>
        <p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case
            of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind
            of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>

            <h1>C</h1>
            <p>is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and
                remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of
                the
                targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though
                decreasingly for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the
                largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>

            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
                with
                the use of significant indentation.

                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a
                "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="java-lang">
            <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
