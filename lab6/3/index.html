        <p>Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication
            between different types of devices over the internet. A web browser is used to access web pages. Web
            browsers can be defined as programs that display text, data, pictures, animation, and video on the Internet.
            Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web
            browsers.Web Technology can be classified into the following sections:
            World Wide Web (WWW): The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies : Web browsers,
            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

            Web Browser: The web browser is an application software to explore www (World Wide Web). It provides an
            interface between the server and the client and requests to the server for web documents and services.

            Web Server: Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with
            files that create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
