                        Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn
                        Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows,
                        PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for
                        PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022. A mobile version of the game designed for
                        touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile was released in May 2022 on Android and iOS. The game
                        supports cross-platform play, excluding the aforementioned mobile platforms.

                        Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed
                        characters with distinctive abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay modes. In
                        "Battle Royale", up to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search
                        for weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available
                        play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find
                        themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In
                        "Arenas", players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team
                        deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their
                        team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.

                        Apex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall
                        series, with several characters from the Titanfall series appearing either as minor characters
                        or playable Legends. Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained a
                        secret right up until its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that
                        point it had been assumed that Respawn Entertainment was working on a third installment to the
                        Titanfall franchise, the studio's previous major game.

                        Apex Legends received generally positive
                        reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, progression system, and fusion of elements from
                        various genres. Some considered it a worthy competitor to other battle royale games. Apex
                        Legends surpassed 25 million players by the end of its first week, and 50 million within its
                        first month. By April 2021, it had approximately 100 million players making it one of the most
                        played video games of all time by player count.
